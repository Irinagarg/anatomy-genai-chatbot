# 🧠 Anatomy AI Tutor – AR/VR Assisted Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
An interactive AI-powered anatomy learning system focused on 5 vital human organs:
- Heart
- Brain
- Lungs
- Liver
- Kidneys

This project aims to enhance medical education using AI-based explanations and (future scope) AR/VR visualization.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional anatomy learning relies heavily on 2D diagrams and textbooks, making it difficult for students to understand 3D spatial relationships of organs.


## 💡 Proposed Solution
We developed a lightweight AI tutor that:
- Answers anatomy-related questions
- Focuses on 5 vital organs in depth
- Provides structured medical explanations
- Is deployable as a web app


## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit (Web Deployment)
- Rule-based AI logic (Free version)
- GitHub (Version Control)


## 🚀 Live Demo
(Insert your Streamlit app link here)

## 🧠 Features
✔ Organ-specific explanations  
✔ Structured anatomy breakdown  
✔ Lightweight & fast  
✔ Fully deployable  


## 🔮 Future Scope
- AR organ visualization
- 3D interactive models
- Quiz mode
- Voice interaction
- Advanced NLP model integration
